This is the customer page of a 3 part project.  The project is a hotel with a customer website to book rooms, a company page to handle the 
physical hotel's needs, and an api/database as the backend.

The three parts are hosted on Github and Heroku. The links can be found here:
1. Customer website - Github [Customer Code][1], Heroku [Customer Website][2]
2. Company website - Github [Company Code][3], Heroku [Company Website][4]
3. Database - Github [Database Code][5]

This is the customer facing website that would tell a bit about the hotel and the area around.  It connects to a database and allows 
for booking.
